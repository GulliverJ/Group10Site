            <h4 style="font-weight: lighter">Our clients tasked us with developing a smart-parking application, built upon the larger sensor network platform. The application was to indicate the state of street-side parking bays across london - where they were, how long they'd been occupied for, whether it was legal to park there, and more. Since starting the project, we've prototyped various hardare for parking bay monitors and produced a fully functioning web app.</h4>

            <p>Of course, a lot of planning and design went into every aspect of this demonstration of the system in use. See below for a detailed analysis of how exactly we did it, and discover how the sensors network streamlines the development process.</p>

               <h3>The MC1322x micro-controller</h3>
              <img class="img-responsive img-rounded" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="img/MC1322.jpg">
              <p>For our project we decided to go with a MC1322x micro-controller. This controller was developed by Freescale as a tool for handling small scale ZigBee communications and sensor control. </p>
              <p>The reason for choosing this specific controller was because early research showed that it was compatible with Contiki, which we were planning to use. 
              Our professor Graeme McPhillips created a board around the controller to allow us to access the different ports more easily. The board is shown below:</p>
              <p><img class="img-rounded" src="img/Stampback.png"> <img class="img-rounded" src="img/Stampfront.png"></p>
              <p>For full documentation on the mc1322x refer to the <a href="img/MC1322x.pdf" >documentation pdf</a></p>
              <p>For full documentation on the Stamp board refer to the <a href="img/stamp.pdf" >documentation pdf</a></p>
              <h3>Contiki</h3>
              <p>Contiki is the software we used to control the micro-controller. 
              The basic idea of Contiki is to provide a set of libraries to take care of low level control of the microcontroller. 
              It skips the step of configuring every input and output of the device so that we are left with easy to use functions for operating ADC inputs and ZigBee.</p>
              <p>For full documentation on Contiki, refer to their website: http://www.contiki-os.org/</p>
              <h3>Infra-Red</h3>
              <p>For our project we went with infra-red to determine the state of our parking bay. 
              Infra-Red allows for a low cost, easy to implement way of determining the state of a car simply by reading a distance measurement.</p>
              <p>The below sensor is the one we used for our project. It is called the Sharp 2Y0A02 Distance Sensor:</p>
              <p><img class="img-rounded"src="img/IR.JPG" > <img class="img-rounded" src="img/IRpin.JPG"></p>
              <p>For full documentation on the device refer to the <a href="img/sharp_gp2y0a02.pdf" >documentation pdf</a></p>
              <p>Control of this device is done via Contiki and the micro-controller, which is shown in our tutorial section.</p>
              <h3>ZigBee</h3>
              <p>For our project we went with ZigBee to handle communications between the different sensor units. 
              It does not handle communication with the Arduino, as that is done with a simple serial connection. </p>
              <p>We went with ZigBee, because it is designed for low power use cases like ours and the Contiki library allowed for easy implementation of this.</p>
              <p>It is the ideal communication protocol for this kind of project, as the range is well within what would be required for parking applications. 
              For use cases unrelated to parking and where distances exceed ~100m per sensor, using other communication devices is recommended. </p>
              <p>For our project we went with ZigBee to handle communications between the different sensor units. 
              It does not handle communication with the Arduino, as that is done with a simple serial connection. </p>
              <p>For full documentation on ZigBee, refer to the <a href="img/ZigBee.pdf" >documentation pdf</a></p>
              <h3>Arduino</h3>
              <img class="img-responsive img-rounded" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="img/ArduinoLogo.png" >
              <p>We used the Arduino in our system to act as our zone controller. 
              For the sake of demonstration, we had to handle global communication via a computer due to the service being down for the shield we were planning to use.
              We used the Arduino Mega along with a Arduino GSM shield:</p>
              <p><img class="img-rounded"src="img/GSMShieldFront.jpg" > <img class="img-rounded" src="img/GSMShieldBack.JPG"></p>
              <p>In a real life implementation of this project, it is recommended to use something smaller than the Arduino, as it draws unnecessary amounts of power.
              The best thing to do would be to attach a GSM shield directly to your sensor unit, instead of using the Arduino as a medium. For the sake of simplicity we chose to use Arduino.</p>
              <p>For more information on Arduino, refer to their website: <a href="http://www.arduino.cc">www.arduino.cc</a></p>

            <h2>Using the Java API for analytics</h2>
            <a class="anchor" id="javaapi"></a>
            <hr>
				<p>
					The general process carried out for analytics is as follows: <br>

			  <div class="imgborder">
              <img class="img-responsive img-rounded" src="img/analyticshighlevelview.png">
              <p>High level abstraction of Analytics</p>
			  </div>
			<p>					
			The CQL database is accessed twice making use of the JAVA API built, data gained from this is processed in the class
			named 'Analytics' and whether a change of state has occurred along with its associated timestamp is uploaded to a
			separate SQL database hosting parking information. Two tables within the parking database are then used to create 
			an SQL view where additional time-based analytics is carried out. Finally, this information is displayed on the front end parking app
			by making use of a mixture of javascript and PHP.</p>
			
			
			
			
			
			
			 <div class="imgborder">
             <img class="img-responsive img-rounded" src="img/.....">
             <p>Class diagram of main classes involved in Analytics</p>
			 </div>
			  
			  
			  
			  
			  
			  
			  
			<p>
			There are three primary Java classes involved in carrying out the back end analytics for the smart parking app.
			<br>
			These are:<br>
				<ul>
				<li>
				<strong>Bay</strong> - <br> For creating Bay objects. The number of objects initialised within the Parking class correspond to the
				number of Bays within the SQL database 'orangeparking'. This class extends the observable design pattern and
				is used to notify the Analytics class's observer when a change in state (occupied/ unoccupied) has occurred so
				an update to the SQL database can occur. 
				</li><li>
				<strong>Parking</strong> - <br>Makes an initial connection to the SQL database to retrieve an initial set of data on all bays present. 
				It also includes an update function which accepts a bay object, creates a new connection and updates the bay_data's
				occupied and state_timespan fields based upon bay_id.
				</li><li>
				<strong>Analytics</strong> - <br>This class represents the main thread running analytics. An initial call is made to the CQL database
				making use of the JAVA API built. This collects the set of all sensor ids (global_ids) of which matches the Bay objects.
				A second call to the CQL database is then made via the API. Given the new time stamp retrieved differs from the previous
				reading's, an assumption is made that an update in the actual CQL database has occurred for that specific sensor id
				associated with a bay. Whether it is occupied or not is then worked out via the sensor reading retrieved. This
				then calls the specific Bay object's setOccupied function and the SQL parking database is updated using the Observer pattern.
				</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p><br><br>
			At present, the majority of analytics is performed within a read-only SQL view table.
			There are two key reasons for this choice. Other than calculating whether a bay is 'occupied' (1 | 0) and the time this state change occurred, all other information of interest to be displayed on our web app is already implicitly known and can be calculated
			in a less resource heavy fashion. Views also update via lazy evaluation, 'on the spot' when called by PHP server-side code on our web app. This is better suited for our purposes as calculations such as 'time remaining' only occur when they are needed (the website is accessed by a user) and are not
			calculated continuously in the background. 
			</p> 
			
		
			<div class="imgborder">
             <img class="img-responsive img-rounded" src="img/sqlviewpreview.png">
             <p>Code snippit from the SQL view</p>
			 </div>
			
			<p>
			The information provided within the view table includes:
			<br>
			<ul>
			<li>
			The nearest available bay <br>
				This is worked out given the current state of a bay. If a bay is unoccupied, then it itself is its nearest
				available bay. Consequently, given a bay is occupied, a list of all unoccupied bays within the area are found 
				and making use of the euclidean distance formula in 2D, the next nearest available bay is identified.
			</li><li>
				Time remaining <br>
				Given a restriction_id and that max_stay is not NULL within the restrictions table of the SQL Parking database,
				Time remaining represents the amount of time left (in seconds) one can be within an occupied bay state while still being 		'legally parked'.
				Likewise, this is only calculated if a bay is occupied. Otherwise if it is unoccupied and max_stay does not list a 
				time restriction, it is set to NULL.
			</li><li>
			Legally occupied<br> 
				The legally occupied field is calculated based on three different conditions.
				Provided a bay is indeed occupied:
					If the current time of occupation exists outside of the restriction start and end timings,
					no restrictions apply. 
					Else if occupation occurs within restricted hours, given the time remaining in seconds when the difference is
					taken from max_stay is still positive, legally occupied is set to true.
				Otherwise, it is set to NULL.
			</li><br>  
			</ul>
			Additional: <br>
			<ul>
			<li>
			Restricted <br>
				Calculates whether restrictions are currently active for a specific bay (joined to a specific restrictions_id)
			</li>
			</ul>
			The schema for the overall orangeparking database can be found <a href="res/orangeparking.sql">here</a>.
